		<h3><a href="tobias.html" id="tobiasLink">Tobias</a>  (* - - - - | 1/5)</h3>
		<p>I found this site from a friend who thought it was funny. I looked into it and saw it was advertising a product but it was so vague on what<br>
			you were buying exactly. specially since the site doesn't really have an order page. I was jokingly refreshing the page in front of my friends<br>
			in a call and managed to somehow stumble on an actual ordering checkout page, weirdly enough I was not even asked for any payment info, so I<br>
			thought it would be funny to order from the site while my friends watched.</p>
		<p>I had completely forgotten about this as I had moved on and thought it was just a joke. until a couple of weeks later when a completely blank<br>
			package arrived at my door with no sender, just a note taped onto the package "superfuckingmario", inside was only an NES game cartridge. there<br>
			was no sticker on it, only my name written on it with a faded marker. I thought this was a joke? because it felt like I was in one of those old<br>
			cheesy internet creepypastas, so I thought of just throwing it out, however I do remember having my old Childhood NES down in my basement storage,<br>
			so out of curiosity I set it up to play the cartridge.</p>
		<p>The game booted up and there really wasn't much to see, it looked like a romhack of SMB1, but stripped out of everything that made it SMB1, the<br>
			player sprite didnt look like Mario as you would expect. I'd honestly say its hard to describe. The gameplay consisted of just walking forward on<br>
			a plane, so I ended up walking for around a couple of minutes until I gave up on it and just turned the console off and forgot about it for the rest of the day.</p>
		<p>I did tell my friends about it a couple of days later and they thought it was interesting that I somehow managed to get a package from the site,<br>
			I tried to set up my webcam to stream the game to my friends but for some reason the webcam would not record the screen. during this I noticed<br>
			that the game had changed from when I played it last time.</p>
		<p>There is something wrong with this game. I feel strange when I'm not playing it.</p>
		<p>Don't buy from superfuckingmario, there is something wrong.</p>
